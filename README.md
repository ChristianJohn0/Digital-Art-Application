## Features 
### Dash line
The dash line is just a simple dash line with dash length = 20 and dash offset = 20. The dash line mode is an added kivy line property.

### Connected lines
The connected lines brush is simply a straight line in which after a line is drawn the next line starts from the end position of the previous line.

### Circle
This is just a simple circle.

### Mesh
The operations of the mesh mode or brush can really be explained in words. The only way one can understand its operations is to play around with it.

### Redo
The redo functionality as it sounds, a redo button. This is redo a work which may have been cancel by the undo button.

### Erase
A simple eraser.

### Screen recorder
This is one of the functionalities that took majority of my time as I had to do some research in the kivy documentation. I found that they had a module which can be basically used to takes screen recording to the whole application (Module: kivy.input.recorder). I used this module to take screen records, play this records, pause if needed, stop to end recording, play recent to play a recoding which may have taken place in a former application.

## Review
Due to the fact that a screen recording is used just for taking records. I made the review for playing all the work which has been done from the beginning and pause if necessary to be able to continue working from what ever point in time the user wants.
I also changed my design to making use of icons for the brushes instead of words.
